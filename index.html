					<h1> 9 Reasons Why Rabbits Make Good Pets!!</h1>
					<div class="grid-container">
						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbits help you get healthy.</h3>Rabbits help you get healthy as herbivores, rabbits mesh well with vegetarian and vegan lifestyles. Generally speaking, though, having a pet who encourages you to stock your fridge with fruits and vegetables is good for everybody â€” vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>They provide  better companionship</h3>Having a rabbit as a pet is perfect for those who may not have time for daily walks, but still seek the social quality of a dog-like companion. And, like cats, rabbits can be litter box trained very easily. Best of both worlds!</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbits live long life</h3>Rabbits have long lifespans compared to other small animals. They can live 10-12 years if provided with a proper diet and care.</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbis are heroic</h3>Rabbits are heroic. In the wild, rabbits communicate with each other about perceived dangers by thumping their back legs; astute house bunnies will provide you with a similar security system.</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbits are quiet</h3>If you live in an apartment building or have nearby neighbors, animal sounds can be a big concern.Rabbits male little or no noise as they are typically very quiet - no barking, whining, meowing, etc. that could upset housemates, neighbors, and landlords! plus hey do not require a lot of space</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbits can purr when contended</h3>Contrary to dogs or particularly vocal cats, rabbits are very quiet animals. They make the occasional sound, but by and large, they're not much for making noise</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbits form strong bonds</h3>Rabbits are intelligent and emotionally complex creatures. Rabbits are very loving, social animals, which means they not only love to spend time with their humans they require it.</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>They are always fun</h3>Rabbits are uniquely talented comedians. Bunnies do somewhat of (little hop-spins and kicks they do when they're happy), bunny flops (flopping over and playing dead) are just some of the quirky and amusing habits of the house bunny.</div>

						<div class="grid-item">
							<h3>Rabbits are great listeners</h3>Merely looking at them (just look at those ears!). They also make excellent snugglers with their extra-soft fur and loving nature. What more could you ask for from a friend?</div>
